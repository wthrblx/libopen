# Batteries for Welcome To Hell

A mirror of Welcome To Hell's in-house open source packages usable for tower
scripting.

The concept for this repository is based on
[Studio Elttob's LibOpen,](https://github.com/Elttob/LibOpen) though born as a
consequence of separating batteries included for Welcome To Hell's tower
scripting standard library.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that this repository is a read-only mirror, and does not accept

LibOpen is designed to have no external dependencies.
Packages in LibOpen may depend on each other; it should be placed as siblings
in the data model.
